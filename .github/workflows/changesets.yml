# Release: version packages and publish to npm via Changesets.
# Best practice: single release branch (main). On push to main:
# - If there are pending changesets → opens "Version Packages" PR (version bump + CHANGELOG).
# - When that PR is merged → runs version-packages then publish (npm publish).
# Requires: NPM_TOKEN secret (npm auth token with publish rights).
